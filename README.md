# Kombucha-Fermentation

Research into two Kombucha Fermentation Studies under the supervision of Dr. Junling Ma, including the digitization of data from two different kombucha studies, the genesis of a general model from the theoretical biological underpinnings of the fermentation process, fitting the model with Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm (Mean Square Error) and the resulting fitment of the model to the studies. My tasks included literature review, digitization of the study data, running the R scripts (with weekly supervision meetings to enhance the code), generating plots, and writing the research paper.
